# Snake_game
Classic snake game created using Python programming with turtle graphics and concepts of OOPs in Python. 
A little overview of the logic behind: 📝
Using turtle graphics the code first created segments of the snake (initially 3 in no)
The food element is created using the turtle shape and placed at random places every time it touches the snake's body.🐍
Snake segments are updated after each encounter with the food element. 🍴🥝
Lastly, the scoreboard increases the number accordingly and displays GAME OVER for certain conditions, try and find out when the game gets over 😉
Enjoy!🌟
